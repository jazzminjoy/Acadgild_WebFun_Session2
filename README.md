Acadgil Front End Web Development Fundamentals, Session 2, HTML5, Assignments

There are four assignments combined into one document.  They assignments are as follows:

2.1 Create an unordered and ordered list giving the scrambled eggs recipe output as shown in the instructions.

2.2 Use fieldset, legend, and form tags to create an HTML form as shown in the instructions.

2.3 Design an HTML page to show an Alkaline - Acid table and an associated color for each value.

2.4 Design an HTML blog.

Although the page would be better coded using CSS, the challenge was to only use HTML.
